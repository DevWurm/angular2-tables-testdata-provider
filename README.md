# Angular2-Tables Test Data provider
The purpose of this tool is to get a low-middle sized dataset and provide them in a database as test data for the Angular2-Tables evaluation example app.<br>
To do so it downloads 1 Week of the [Wikipedia Pagecount dataset](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/other/pagecounts-raw/).
